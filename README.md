# Easier-items-datapck
For people who want easier access to some of minecrafts harder to aquire/end-game items

# What is the purpose of this datapack?
Minecraft has a lot of end game items that are quite tricky to aqquire, and hece this pack endeavours to deacrease the difficulty of aqquisiton of those items. For example, a full netherite block costs 9 ingots in vanilla. Installing this datapack alters the recipe to need 1 diamond block and 1 netherite ingot in a smithing table

# Features
1. Reducing netherite block cost from 9 ingots to 1 diamond block and one ingot created within the smithing table

**More coming soon!**

# Versioning
This pack is 1.16.x at it's oldest. I am **NOT** going to back port any of these changes to any other versions
I will try my hardest to updates this pack, in its latest release at the time, on the day of the next version release and will add further features as i get a chance to evaluate the difficulty of the new items
