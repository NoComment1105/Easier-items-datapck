For people who want easier access to some of Minecraft's harder to acquire/end-game items

### What is the purpose of this datapack?
Minecraft has a lot of end game items that are quite tricky to acquire, and hence this pack endeavours to decrease the difficulty of acquisition of those items. For example, a full netherite block costs 9 ingots in vanilla. Installing this datapack alters the recipe to need 1 diamond block and 1 netherite ingot in a smithing table

### Features
1. Reducing netherite block cost from 9 ingots to 1 diamond block and one ingot created within the smithing table

2. Reducing the netherite ingot cost from 4 scrap and 4 gold down to 3 scrap and gold.

**More coming soon!**

### Versioning
This pack is 1.16.x at it's oldest. I am **NOT** going to back port any of these changes to any other versions
I will try my hardest to updates this pack, in its latest release at the time, on the day of the next version release and will add further features as i get a chance to evaluate the difficulty of the new items

### Compiling / Using this pack
If you choose to download the .zip of this repository, to correctly use this pack you need to do a couple of things
1. You need to separate easier_items_vx.x from the rest of the .zip
2. Compress easier_items_vx.x into a .zip file itself
3. Put into your data packs folder in your Minecraft save/server files and you're ready to use
